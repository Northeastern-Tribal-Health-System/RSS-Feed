        <p>Men's Health Month raises awareness of the critical aspects of men's healthâ€”physical, mental, and social connection.</p>
        <h3>Men's Physical Health</h3>
        <p>Visit <a href="https://menshealthmonth.org">menshealthmonth.org</a> to download a men's health checklist.</p>
        <p>A complete list of recommended adult vaccinations is available from the CDC: <a href="https://cdc.gov">cdc.gov</a>.</p>

        <h3>Men's Mental Health</h3>
        <p>Mental health significantly influences overall well-being. Men are less likely to seek help but must recognize and address symptoms of depression and anxiety. Open conversations about mental health can reduce stigma.</p>

        <h3>The Importance of Social Connection</h3>
        <p>Strong social connections are vital for health. Loneliness increases the risk of heart disease, dementia, stroke, depression, and anxiety. Building and maintaining social connections can improve overall health and reduce premature mortality. Even simple actions, such as contacting friends or community volunteering, greatly benefit mental well-being.</p>

        <p>Men's Health Month encourages proactive health management. Contact a provider today for health screenings and assessments.</p>
