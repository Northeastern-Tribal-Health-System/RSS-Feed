      <link>Smoking Cessation</link>
      <description> Cigarette smoking is more common among American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) people than almost any other racial or ethnic group in the United States.  It’s never too late to quit smoking. Quitting smoking now improves your health and reduces your risk of heart disease, cancer, lung disease, and other smoking-related illnesses. For help with quitting, talk to your provider or contact a Public Health Nurse at (918) 332-4343 or (918) 332-4306.</description>
